# Retail Arbitrage Listings

> Photo batches for Facebook Marketplace delegation

---

## Delegate Instructions

**When you complete listings, follow this process:**

1. Create all listings on the marketplace first
2. Collect ALL listing URLs as you go
3. **Send URLs in a SINGLE batch message** (do not send one-off links)
4. Use this format for each item:
   ```
   Item Name: <listing URL>
   ```

**Example batch submission:**
```
HP ZBook Fury 15.6" G8: https://facebook.com/marketplace/item/123456
Trek FX Hybrid Bike: https://facebook.com/marketplace/item/789012
DJI Mic 2: https://facebook.com/marketplace/item/345678
```

This enables efficient repo updates and tracking.
