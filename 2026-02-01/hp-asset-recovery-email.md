Dear HP IT Asset Recovery Team,

I am a former HP employee (departure date: March 15, 2024) writing to resolve an outstanding equipment matter.

**Equipment Details:**
- **Model:** HP ZBook Fury 15.6 inch G8 Mobile Workstation
- **Product ID:** 518Y3UC#ABA
- **Serial Number:** CND2245FBM
- **RMN:** HSNC13C-5

**Existing Case Reference:** CS0337651 (opened April 12, 2024)

**Timeline:**
- **March 15, 2024** - My termination/departure date from HP
- **April 12, 2024** - I opened case CS0337651 to return this equipment
- **April 15, 2024** - Cinthia Albores requested my personal email to continue the process
- **After April 2024** - No further communication received; no return box arrived

I confirmed my personal email (wil.moore@wilmoore.com) but never received a shipping box or further instructions. The case appears to have gone dormant.

As a former employee, I no longer have access to myITNow to check case status. It has now been approximately 10 months since my departure, and I would like to formally resolve this matter. I am requesting one of the following:

1. **A prepaid return shipping label/box** to return the equipment, or
2. **A formal release/waiver** allowing me to dispose of or retain the equipment, given the extended time elapsed and my documented good-faith return attempts

I want to ensure this is handled properly and in compliance with HP policy. Please advise on the appropriate next steps.

**My Contact Information:**
- Name: [YOUR FULL NAME]
- Former Employee ID: [IF KNOWN]
- Personal Email: [YOUR EMAIL]
- Phone: [YOUR PHONE]

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this matter.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]

## Tips for Success

1. **Be proactive and professional** - You're trying to do the right thing
2. **Document this outreach** - Screenshot/save the email you send
3. **Follow up in 2 weeks** if no response
4. **Request written confirmation** of whatever resolution they provide
5. **Keep the laptop safe** until you have written authorization to sell/dispose

## If They Want It Back
- They'll send a prepaid label
- Ship it back, get tracking number
- Done

## If They Release It
- Request this **in writing** (email is fine)
- Save the confirmation permanently
- You're clear to sell

## If No Response After Multiple Attempts
- Document all your outreach attempts with dates
- After 60-90 days of no response, you've demonstrated good faith
- Consider sending a final "certified letter" for paper trail
- Consult with a lawyer if the value warrants it ($600-900 range)
